# IAM Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies

**IAM users**

By default, users cannot access anything in your account.

**Groups**

A group is a collection of users. You can also apply a policy to a group.

**Roles**

A role is something that is assumed by a trusted entity, and you use this for delegation. This is a slightly complex subject

**Policies**

Policies are documents that define permissions and can be applied to users, groups, and roles. Policy documents are written in JSON (key-value pair that consists of an attribute and a value).

# IAM Authentication Methods

**Access Keys**

An access key is composed of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. We use this for programmatic access to AWS.

**Console password**

This is a typical username and password.
